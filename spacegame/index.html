        <h2>How To Play</h2>
        <p>
            Space Scape is an easy game to learn but difficult to master. You are a space traveler but a horde of evil space aliens now wants you dead,
            you will have to dodge their laser fire as you rocket through space dodging meteors and UFO's. Space Scape is endless, however it gets increasingly
            difficult as your score increases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game controls are the up, down, left and right arrow keys. Your rocket is constanly flying up however you can slow your rocket temporarily by 
            pressing the down key, beware though because if you slow too much the aliens will catch up and you may crash. Your rocket will return to full 
            speed when you release that key. You also have the left and right keys to dodge incoming projectiles. The up arrow allows you to shoot object that are
            above you.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 4 ways to die in Space Scape. If you collide with an alien spaceship, if you get hit by a laser, if you collide with a meteor and if you 
            collide with a UFO. If you are unsure how close you can get to aliens, meteorites and UFO's you can toggle hit boxes to show the boundaries of each game 
            object. If you just want to see how the game works you can toggle God mode and forget all about death.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 2 consumable items in the game as well. Because your ammo is finite you have to restock, Throughout the game there will be ammo boxes you can 
            collect. they look like this <img src="resources/ammoImage.png" width="25" height="25">. You can also find nukes which will blow up all current enemies 
            on the screen. They look like this <img src="resources/nuke.png" width="25" height="25">.

        <h2>About The Game</h2>
        <p>
            To keep the code clean and readable I used classes and then functions to add enemies or objects as needed. the background is a seamless image of space
            that simply keeps repeating to give the illusion of constant motion. There is a variable gameSpeed that singlehandedly controls how quickly new enemies are 
            added into the game. This works by subtracting the current score from an ititial set interval, thus each time the score increases the interval decreases. it 
            is limited to make sure that a reasonable minimum interval always exists. once the player reaches a score of 3500 the game does not get anymore difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finding sprites for this project was suprisingly hard and full sprite sheets was even harder. As such there are a couple of things that I would point out, 
            firstly the rocket sprite didnt come as a sprite sheet so in order to animate the thruster I had to use an inverted image of a candle flame sprite sheet 
            that I did find. The meteor also came as a single image so I just saved four images of it and rotated each one and combined them into a sprite sheet that way, 
            there was no good examples of certain game assets such as the icons for ammo and nukes so they are custom made.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sound effects were not hard to find however I found that the browser console would display an error because it didnt like those effects autoplaying. to 
            combat that the game requires the user to first press the start button on the page and then the startGame function will register that and start the game. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To make the game mechanics unique you cant move up with any keys instead the player will always want to return to a specified heigth on canvas. As it aproaches 
            that height it slows down gradually to make it apear smoother. Making the ammo finite makes the game more difficult and strategic so you have to think about 
            using it more carefully. Also each enemy uses a differant moevement pattern. the aliens chasing the Player go from left to right shooting at random intervals,
            the meteors fall from a random X coordinate at a random speed and X direction, the UFO's travel from left to right along a sine wave.
