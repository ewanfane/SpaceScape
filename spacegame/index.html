        <h2>How To Play</h2>
        <p>
            Space Scape is an easy game to learn but difficult to master. You are a space traveler but a horde of evil space aliens now wants you dead,
            you will have to dodge their laser fire as you rocket through space dodging meteors and UFO's. Space Scape is endless, however it gets increasingly
            difficult as your score increases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game controls are the up, down, left and right arrow keys. Your rocket is constanly flying up however you can slow your rocket temporarily by 
            pressing the down key, beware though because if you slow too much the aliens will catch up and you may crash. Your rocket will return to full 
            speed when you release that key. You also have the left and right keys to dodge incoming projectiles. The up arrow allows you to shoot object that are
            above you.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 4 ways to die in Space Scape. If you collide with an alien spaceship, if you get hit by a laser, if you collide with a meteor and if you 
            collide with a UFO. If you are unsure how close you can get to aliens, meteorites and UFO's you can toggle hit boxes to show the boundaries of each game 
            object. If you just want to see how the game works you can toggle God mode and forget all about death.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 2 consumable items in the game as well. Because your ammo is finite you have to restock, Throughout the game there will be ammo boxes you can 
            collect. they look like this <img src="resources/ammoImage.png" width="25" height="25">. You can also find nukes which will blow up all current enemies 
            on the screen. They look like this <img src="resources/nuke.png" width="25" height="25">.

        <h2>About The Game</h2>
        <p>
            SpaceScape was one of the first projects I built using JS, due to this its likely to have many inneficiencies and redundancies. I dont currently 
            maintain or update this project however every now and again I get a spark of interest and make some minor adjustments. I released it on GitHub as 
            an example of an easy game that anyone can make with a little bit of time and will.
